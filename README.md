# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Here is my solution for the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7). I tried my best to make the design as close as possible to the original.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While doing the challenge I realize grid requires great focusing. But if we use it right it works well as it is a very practical solution for flexibility.

```html
<h1>Below you can see some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
<h2>Took time to figure out lol ðŸŽ‰</h2>
```
```css
main {
        
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 2fr ;
        grid-template-areas: 
        "clifford"
        "clifford"
        "walters"
        "harmon"
        "abrams"
        "abrams"
        "whittle"
        "whittle"
        ;
}
```
